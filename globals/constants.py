    Welcome to %gEarth:%&&\n\
    A familiar place in a distant time.$$\
    The homeworld of the %rRevelers%,&&\n\
    or %rHumans%, as the ancient\n\
    ones refer to them.$$\
    Our universe has been at war with\n\
    this %rinvasive species% for millennia.$$\
    I am a %wWayweaver%.&&\n\
    *.%wI move through space as I please,*,\n\
    at whatever speed I desire%.$$\
    I am the only one of %wmy kind% in the universe.$$\
    I have no homeworld,\n\
    %wfor I was birthed by the stars%.$$\
    Long have I searced for another %wlike me%,\n\
    *,but to no aveil.$$\
    A century ago, the %pAllies of the Universe%\n\
    were successfull in forcing the\n\
    %rRevelers% to retreat back to their %ghomeworld%.$$\
    My earliest memories are from around then,&&\n\
    aimlessly drifting through space,\n\
    watching a cataclysmic war\n\
    unfold before me.$$\
    I chose to help preserve the universe by hunting\n\
    %rRevelers% across space,\n\
    and the other beings\n\
    of the cosmos nourished me\n\
    with food and knowledge in return.$$\
    Now only %r11 Revelers% remain.&&\n\
    They’ve survived on %gEarth% for half a century.$$\
    But today,*. I’ve decided to put an end\n\
    to this chapter of the universe's history.$$\
    I'll hunt down %rall 11% of them\n\
    who have yet to perish.$$\
    However, traversing %gEarth% is like\n\
    stepping foot directly into into\n\
    a %rpredator’s claws%.$$\
    I’m no rabbit, but I’m hunting\n\
    the universe’s %rapex predator%.&&\n\
    What they lack in numbers,\n\
    they far make up for in knowledge\n\
    of their first planet.$$\
    \n\n\
