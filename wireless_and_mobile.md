##  Elements of a Wireless Network
### Hosts
Hosts run applications
- laptop
- smartphone
- home applications

Hosts can be stationary (non-mobile).<br>
Wireless != Mobile

### Base Station
- **connected to a wired network**
- **relays packets** between wired network and wireless hosts in its designated area
- function as 4G/5G cell towers or WiFi access points (APs)

### Wireless Link
- **connects** devices to the **base station**
- "backbone link"
- Multiple Access protocol coordinates link access
